        <p class="mt-3">
          The jack-of-all trades, Bert, introduces us to England in 1910 and the troubled Banks family. Young Jane and Michael have sent many a nanny packing before Mary Poppins arrives on their doorstep. Using a combination of magic and common sense, she must teach the family members how to value each other again. Mary Poppins takes the children on many magical and memorable adventures, but Jane and Michael aren't the only ones upon whom she has a profound effect. Even grown-ups can learn a lesson or two from the nanny who advises that "Anything can happen if you let it."

            The magic was in the air as Mary Poppins Jr. took flight at the Players on Air Theater Company, delivering a delightful and heartwarming performance that showcased the impressive talents of a young and spirited cast.

From the very first note to the final curtain call, the production was a testament to excellent direction and seamless stagecraft. The set and scene transitions flowed effortlessly, keeping the pace brisk and engaging throughout. The choreography stood out as a highlight, bringing energy and polish to every musical number.</p>

</p>One of the most crowd-pleasing moments of the evening came during the tap-heavy ensemble number “Step In Time.” The whole cast lit up the stage with infectious rhythm and joy, tapping in perfect sync and clearly having a blast. It was a standout moment that had the audience grinning and tapping along in their seats.

The cast as a whole was simply charming. The Banks children sang beautifully together, capturing both the innocence and emotional depth of their characters. Bert was a true scene-stealer with his incredible dancing and physicality—his every movement brought a burst of joy to the stage. And then there was Mary Poppins herself: with poise, grace, and a commanding presence, the young actress in the title role truly was “practically perfect in every way.” Her performance had just the right mix of charm and authority to keep everyone “Spit Spot!”</p>

<p>While the show was a joy to watch, there were occasional sound issues that caused the audio to fade in and out, making it difficult at times to hear the vocals and music. Even so, the cast pushed through these hiccups with professionalism and enthusiasm.

All in all, Mary Poppins Jr. was a crowd-pleasing production full of heart, talent, and theatrical magic. The Players on Air Theater Company should be proud of this enchanting show—and audiences should be sure not to miss it!</p>
